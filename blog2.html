                <h3>The Second Amendment: How a Comma caused a Constitutional Crisis</h3>
                <p>The right to bear arms. There is perhaps no other right or freedom in the Constitution that is so strongly debated as this one; some people glorify guns while others vilify them. But the second amendment isn’t really a complex idea, although it is a complicated one. The layman need not worry about reading a 27-thousand-page document because the entirety of U.S. gun law comes down to 27 words and 3 commas in the 2nd-Amendment: “A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed”. Every single word of that statement has been deeply and thoroughly researched and discussed, notably in the book ‘Gun Control on Trial’ by Brian Doherty, yet the meaning is still hazy. Each and every phrase of the statement has been broken down like ‘militia’, ‘bear arms’ and ‘necessary’. </p>
                <p>However, it has been argued that the terms used don’t matter nearly as much as the punctuation; specifically, the second comma dividing the segment about militias with that regarding the right of the people. The crux of the statement is about the right to bear arms, but to whom this applies is a matter of great debate. Even linguists are up-in-arms on both sides of the aisle, many say that the statement was two phrases while others still regard the right to bear arms extending only to militias. </p>
                <p>Unlike other major discussions about punctuation, however, this debate has a tendency to get supporters on both sides riled up because this isn’t simply about poetry, it is quite literally a life-and-death matter.</p>
                <p>We must protect the lives of innocents like students but we must also protect the rights of our countrymen to access and conceal guns and other weapons. We must make sure that the citizens of this great nation feel safe within it and are shielded from the horrors of violent crime. All of that is at stake because of a comma. I personally believe that gun rights can be sacrificed to an extent in an effort to protect the lives of innocent civilians however the people’s right to bear arms shall not be infringed in the process. And I do acknowledge the fine points the other side makes about logistics and personal freedom. </p>
                <p>For example, we must look at how difficult it would be to even try to restrict private ownership of firearms. According to the Washington Post, For every hundred residents in our nation, there are more than hundred-and-twenty guns. That means even if we banned guns for civilian use, there’d be hundreds of millions of guns still in circulation which couldn’t be removed from private ownership lest we risk legal challenges or maybe even civil unrest. One must ask themselves, would it even be plausible to ban gun ownership this late in our history? I think not.                 </p>
                <p>In the District of Columbia v. Heller case in 2008, gun-rights-activists sued DC because of its handgun ban, claiming the ban violated citizens' 2nd Amendment rights. Ultimately, the Supreme Court sided with pro-gun rights activists. Justice Antonin Scalia delivered the majority opinion stating that the sentence was two separate phrases divided by a comma. A landmark ruling came down to nothing but a comma! </p>
                <p>This decision broke the precedent set in the United States v. Miller case from 1939 when the Supreme Court had agreed that restrictions on the Second Amendment were simply like the restrictions put on other Amendments. For example, many gun-control supporters cite the restrictions on the First Amendment, which guarantees unabridged free speech. Despite this guarantee, the use of profane language or even certain phrases expressing intent to commit a crime can land a person in enormous trouble with the authorities. However, this is constitutionally-upheld as it is simply a restriction, not a complete ban on free speech. Gun control supporters argue that like the First Amendment, restrictions can be placed on gun rights without violating the Second Amendment. The restrictions on free speech can be compared to the already-existing restrictions on the second amendment. These constitutional regulations include prohibiting gun ownership by convicts and the mentally ill and limits on what types of weapons can be carried in a certain location.                 </p>
                <p>Legally speaking, according to Heller, the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to bear arms, and the right to use that firearm within traditionally legal settings, such as in one’s home. However, this does not entitle an individual to break the law. While the legal interpretation is as clear as glass thanks in part to Heller, we the people still interpret the right to bear arms differently. So we must be grateful for the Supreme Court’s work, even if we may not agree with it, for clarifying and interpreting a small group of words and commas which have an extraordinary impact on the American way of life. This base interpretation sets a major precedent for the future regarding gun rights with which our posterity can build upon, use, and even change. That is the what is so great about the Constitution; no matter how old it or any of its amendments get, there is always a court to interpret it based on the views of the time.</p>
